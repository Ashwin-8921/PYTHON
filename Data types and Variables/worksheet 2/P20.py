#Can a Python variable change its data type after assignment? 
#Give an example and explain the implications.


x = 10          
print(type(x))  

x = "hello"     
print(type(x))  




#Yes, in Python, a variable can change its data type after assignment.
#This is because Python is dynamically typed, meaning:

#Variables are not bound to a specific data type.

#Values have types, not the variables themselves
