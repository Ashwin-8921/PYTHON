What is the difference between None, 0, False, and "" in Python? Are they the same or different as variables? How does Python treat them in conditional statements?


In Python, None, 0, False, and "" are different types but all are treated as False in conditional statements.
They are not equal to each other and represent different concepts: None means no value, 0 is an integer, False is a boolean, and "" is an empty string.
