What is the difference between mutable and immutable data types in Python? Name three types from each category.

Mutable Data Types:
Can be changed after they are created.
You can modify, add, or delete elements without changing the object address.
eg: list, dict, set

Immutable Data Types:
Cannot be changed after creation.
Any change creates a new object.
eg: int, str,  tuple
